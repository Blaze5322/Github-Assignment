Behavioral Finance & AI Decision Models

📌 Overview

Behavioral Finance studies how psychological biases and emotions influence financial decisions.
Traditional finance assumes rational investors, but real-world decisions are often irrational and predictable in their irrationality.

AI Decision Models use machine learning and data-driven systems to detect, model, and reduce behavioral biases in financial decision-making.

🧠 Part 1: Behavioral Finance
1. Traditional Finance vs Behavioral Finance
Traditional Finance	Behavioral Finance
Investors are rational	Investors are psychologically biased
Markets are efficient	Markets can be inefficient
Decisions maximize utility	Decisions influenced by emotion
2. Key Psychological Biases
2.1 Cognitive Biases

Overconfidence Bias
Investors overestimate their knowledge or predictive ability.

Confirmation Bias
Seeking information that supports existing beliefs.

Anchoring Bias
Relying too heavily on the first piece of information (e.g., stock purchase price).

Availability Heuristic
Decisions based on recent or memorable events.

2.2 Emotional Biases

Loss Aversion
Losses hurt more than equivalent gains feel good.

Herd Behavior
Following the crowd without independent analysis.

Regret Aversion
Avoiding decisions to prevent future regret.

Mental Accounting
Treating money differently based on its source.

3. Prospect Theory

Developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky.

Key ideas:

People value gains and losses differently.

Losses are psychologically stronger than gains.

Investors are:

Risk-averse in gains

Risk-seeking in losses

Value function shape:

Concave for gains

Convex for losses

Steeper for losses

🤖 Part 2: AI Decision Models in Finance
1. What Are AI Decision Models?

🧩 Key Insight

Markets are not just driven by numbers.
They are driven by human psychology.

AI does not replace behavioral finance.
It enhances it by identifying and correcting predictable irrationality.
